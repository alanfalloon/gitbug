Problem description:
 Merging two repositories with new bugs added will cause several
 bugs with the same id.

How to reproduce:
 git checkout -b foo
 gitbug add foo
 git checkout master
 gitbug add bar
 git merge foo
 tree bugs
bugs
|-- all
|   |-- 0001_bar
|   `-- 0001_foo
 

Proposed solution:
 Use truncated hash?

Eridius on #ocaml had the following idea:
 Use a truncated hash internally.
 FIX[x] in commit message references to either unique hash prefix or 
 position on current open list (list should print stable position numbers.)
 Have a commit-msg hook that edits FIX[x] into FIX[hash]

FIXED

using a 6-byte timestamp now, it won't collide as easily
but it's a usability nightmare

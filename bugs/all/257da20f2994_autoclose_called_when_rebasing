Problem description:

When doing a rebase, autoclose kicks in after each commit is re-applied,
resulting in a conflict in the bug (different close date).

How to reproduce:

git rebase -i some_commit_before_an_autoclosed_bug

Proposed solution:

Somehow detect when we're in the middle of a rebase. git knows that, so it
must be creating some file in .git.
